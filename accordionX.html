                    <p>The uncertainty that comes with being relocated from one’s day to day familiar routines is one big challenge for those being relocated. It is however for this reason that TE&amp;OT promises to help you understand various life aspects in areas that you might have been relocated to. Through reconnaissance visits that are conducted by professionals who are part of our thoroughly comprehensive team, their main agenda is to make sure that you have been able to get the most detailed information about the city you might have been assigned to. Making sure that our clients have specific details of where they are to be relocated to, we believe, ensures that you can make better informed choices.</p>
                    <p>Being fully acquitted with their prospective city of transfer is also another way through which we at TE&amp;OT make sure that our customers have the right mindset when they eventually make the move. Through the pre-assignment visits that we facilitate for our clientele, we eliminate the possibility of various shocks that come with major life changes such as migration. Whether it is on matters to do with significant cultural changes, major school systems changes for their children, language barriers that they might potentially be confronted with, these visits try to prepare you before you have officially relocated. Through the understanding of various expectations that are laid up by societies that live in these geographical areas, in religion or even cultures, we make sure that our clientele is properly acquainted with all these changes. This are sure is the only way to make their transitions as simplified as possible. We believe that being prepared comes from the empowerment that is a result of being well informed.</p>
                    <p>TE&amp;OT ensures that the potential transferees are carefully prepared through a comprehensive itineraryin a manner that provides them with the right guidance. Making you aware of the various lifestyles options that are available for you is also another reason for these visits. Some of these important settlement issues include, various ways through which you can acquire a home, residency terms, and schooling factors for your children as well as the approximated cost of living. This way, you are indeed able to have an actual living experience before you have actually made the real move.</p>
                    <p>We consider it important for you to be able to not only tell, but also to experience the kind of life that you will be experiencing once you have relocated. We understand the level of sacrifice that comes with this kind of relocations and it is for that reason that we make sure your transition is as smooth as it should be .Availing information to you before the actual transfer to a new country not only helps our clients be prepared to take up their new roles and residency, but it also literally helps them hit the ground running once they are in their designated work areas.

Any worker listed for such relocation should therefore consider these services as they come in handy to properly prepare them. As you have seen, our services cater for both the professional and the personal interests to our customers.</p>

This way, we ensure that you have been able to benefit from all that what you are entitled to. Knowing that you are able to make sense of all the numbers that entail possible expenses as well as tax management is one way through which we make this a possibility.

                    <p>As part of our destination services, the orientation visit is also commonly referred to as the look-see visit. This visit acts as one of the most valuable tools for people that are planning to relocate. Due to work demands, people are forced to relocate to areas where they probably have never had any interest exploring.  It is for this reason that we conduct orientation visits so as to help them familiarize themselves with these areas.  Through engaging of people who have vast knowledge about these areas, we ensure that you are able to learn as much as possible concerning the host country on a personal level. The understanding of the fact that learning through a participatory manner is the best form of learning is what drives this decision.</p>
                    <p>TE&amp;OT ensures that individuals and their families are able to acquire detailed insights concerning particular areas of relocation. These visits also allow them to gather the most accurate information about the people who live in that particular country, and this way, they are able to interact with them better when they eventually relocate. In general terms, orientation visits serve as an introductory chapter to a new life of the person who is supposed to relocate. These visits allow you to be able to have certain realistic expectations of the country that you are moving to since you have already had an experience in knowing what is expected of you as a member of that particular society. It is through these expectations that one is eventually able to select the part of the social structure that might properly fit their way of life. Whether on issues to do with education, religion, socializing and so on, we cannot over emphasize on the importance of these visits.</p>

                  	<p>TE&amp;OT as well offers other kinds of loyal companions’ relocation services. There are various factors that as a company, we believe influences the kind of charges that we have stipulated as fees to these services. For instance, if we are tasked with the responsibility of transferring your happy tail companions, the companion’s weight, the size of the kennel it is to be relocated in, the location from which it is to depart from and eventually where it will arrive are such factors. Other factors might entail special requests that you might want offered to your happy tail companion and this directly influences the kind of fees that goes towards your companion’s relocation charges. A request for grooming services untimely translates to a higher fee as compared those that does not have that kind of a request as part of its relocation package.</p>

Through the fact that we have the capability of holding or “boarding” your saltwater or freshwater animals  if the need arises, is the other way through which relocating of aquariums is an easy task for us.</p>
